                                        It has already been almost a decade since I liked BTS and honestly can never imagine leaving the fandom.
                                        I listen to their songs almost everyday and their work ethic has really inspired me to work harder in order 
                                        to achieve my goals!

                                            <h3>Legend of Zelda</h3>
                                            <p>My favourite game franchize!</p>
                                        </div>

                                    <p>
                                        Ever since I've played Breath of the Wild, I've become super obessed with the Zelda franchize.
                                        The gameplay was so cool but the stories were even better! I loved it so much that I also brought
                                        the sequel (Tears of the Kingdom)!

                                        Ever since primary I've always loved STEM subjects and after trying out tech related subjects
                                        I realised I really enjoy the coding experience, especially making new things! It's so satisfying!

                                    <p>
                                        Anime has always been on my mind since I was a child, but Demon Slayer places a special spot in my mind!
                                        I really like the story and all the characters. My favourite is Tanjiro!
